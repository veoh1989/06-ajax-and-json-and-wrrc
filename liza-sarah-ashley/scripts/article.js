// REVIEW: Instead of a global `articles = []` array, let's attach this list of all articles directly to the constructor function. Note: it is NOT on the prototype. In JavaScript, functions are themselves objects, which means we can add properties/values to them at any time. In this case, the array relates to ALL of the Article objects, so it does not belong on the prototype, as that would only be relevant to a single instantiated Article.
Article.all = [];


// COMMENT: Why isn't this method written as an arrow function?
// This is not an arrow function because it contains the "this" keyword which is scoped globally in arrow functions.
Article.prototype.toHtml = function() {
  let template = Handlebars.compile($('#article-template').text());

  this.daysAgo = parseInt((new Date() - new Date(this.publishedOn))/60/60/24/1000);

  // COMMENT: What is going on in the line below? What do the question mark and colon represent? How have we seen this same logic represented previously?
  // This is a ternary operator. The question mark represents if the condition is true and the colon separates the true return on the left and the false return on the right.
  this.publishStatus = this.publishedOn ? `published ${this.daysAgo} days ago` : '(draft)';
  this.body = marked(this.body);

  return template(this);
};

// REVIEW: There are some other functions that also relate to all articles across the board, rather than just single instances. Object-oriented programming would call these "class-level" functions, that are relevant to the entire "class" of objects that are Articles.

// REVIEW: This function will take the rawData, how ever it is provided, and use it to instantiate all the articles. This code is moved from elsewhere, and encapsulated in a simply-named function for clarity.

// COMMENT: Where is this function called? What does 'rawData' represent now? How is this different from previous labs?
// This function is called at the bottom of this js file inside of Article.fetchAll. The rawData now represents our AJAX file/JASON data file. In previous labs we used a js file that contained all the objects.
Article.loadAll = rawData => {

  rawData.sort((a,b) => (new Date(b.publishedOn)) - (new Date(a.publishedOn)))

  rawData.forEach(articleObject => Article.all.push(new Article(articleObject)))
}

// REVIEW: This function will retrieve the data from either a local or remote source, and process it, then hand off control to the View.
Article.fetchAll = function () {
  // REVIEW: What is this 'if' statement checking for? Where was the rawData set to local storage?
  if (localStorage.rawData) {
    Article.loadAll(JSON.parse(localStorage.rawData));

  } else {
    $.getJSON('data/hackerIpsum.json').then(data => {
      localStorage.rawData = JSON.stringify(data)})
    Article.loadAll(JSON.parse(localStorage.rawData))
    //COMMENT:**Include a comment** which explains how you and your partner determined the sequence of code execution.-> This portion of code was the most difficult for us to determind how to write. We knew the data/hackerIpsum.json would need render, it would need to use both JSON.stringify and JSON.parse then call the Article.loadAll function.
